# Lithic Editor

## Coming Soon

The PyLithics Lithic Editor is a planned feature that will provide manual editing and correction capabilities for lithic analysis results.

## Planned Features

### Interactive Editing
- **Contour adjustment**: Manually refine automatically detected boundaries
- **Classification correction**: Change surface type assignments
- **Feature addition**: Add missed scars or features
- **Feature removal**: Delete incorrectly detected features

### Quality Control
- **Visual validation**: Side-by-side comparison of original and processed images
- **Measurement verification**: Check and adjust automated measurements
- **Annotation tools**: Add notes and comments to specific features
- **Batch corrections**: Apply corrections across multiple similar artifacts

### Integration
- **PyLithics workflow**: Seamless integration with existing processing pipeline
- **Data export**: Export corrected measurements in standard PyLithics format
- **Version tracking**: Maintain history of manual edits
- **Reproducibility**: Document all manual interventions

## Use Cases

### Research Applications
- **Publication quality**: Ensure accuracy for published measurements
- **Problematic specimens**: Handle artifacts that don't process automatically
- **Teaching tool**: Educational platform for learning lithic analysis
- **Method validation**: Compare automated vs. manual measurements

### Technical Applications
- **Algorithm improvement**: Provide training data for better automation
- **Edge case handling**: Develop solutions for challenging specimens
- **Quality assurance**: Systematic validation of automated results
- **Error correction**: Fix systematic processing issues

## Development Timeline

This feature is currently in the planning phase. Development will begin based on:
- User demand and feedback
