# About PyLithics

## The Project

PyLithics began as part of the [Palaeoanalytics project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/palaeoanalytics) (ended), a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and the University of Cambridge, led by Professor Robert Foley. After the original Palaeoanalytics project ended, PyLithics software development has continued as part of the British Academy funded project "Transitions in early stone tool technologies: a computer vision and machine learning approach" (ongoing) led by Dr. Jason Gellis. These innovative projects seek to apply cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision techniques to archaeological research, specifically focusing on the feature extraction and quantitative analysis of prehistoric stone tools from 2D illustrations.

## Research Impact

PyLithics has been designed to support multiple types of archaeological research:

### Methodological Advances
- Quantitative analysis of lithic assemblages
- Standardization of measurement protocols
- Reduction of inter-observer variability
- Large-scale comparative studies

### Archaeological Applications
- Technological analysis of prehistoric industries
- Cultural transmission studies
- Skill assessment in prehistoric populations
- Temporal and spatial variation in tool-making traditions

## Open Science Commitment

PyLithics embodies principles of open science:

- **Open Source**: All code is freely available under GPL v3.0
- **Transparent Methods**: Processing algorithms are fully documented
- **Reproducible Research**: Analysis parameters are recorded and sharable
- **Community Driven**: Development guided by user needs and feedback

## The Team

**Dr. Jason Gellis**

- *British Academy Post-Doctoral Research Fellow [(University of Cambridge)](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-jason-gellis)*
- [jg760@cam.ac.uk](mailto:jg760@cam.ac.uk)
- [@JasonGellis](https://github.com/JasonGellis)

Dr. Gellis leads the technical development of PyLithics and brings expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and archaeological methodology. He has been involved in the project at all stages and currently leads PyLithics development as part of his British Academy funded research. His research focuses on the intersection of computational methods and archaeological science.

**Prof. Robert Foley**

- *Principal Investigator [(University of Cambridge)](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/raf10)*
- [raf10@cam.ac.uk](mailto:raf10@cam.ac.uk)
- [@Rob-LCHES](https://github.com/Rob-LCHES)

Professor Foley is an evolutionary and biological anthropologist with research interests in human evolution, particularly the ecological basis for patterns and processes of human behavioural evolution. His work covers social evolution, speciation and extinction in hominins, hunter-gatherer ecology, and the origins of modern humans, applying evolutionary models to human evolution through both palaeobiological and contemporary biological methods. He has contributed extensively to the development of the African origin of modern humans field, working across fossils, genetics and archaeology, and is currently engaged in field projects focusing on the evolution of modern humans in Africa. Professor Foley led the Alan Turing Institute portion of the original Palaeoanalytics project and continues to participate in PyLithics development as an advisor, providing archaeological expertise and project oversight.


**Dr. Camila Rangel Smith**

- *Research Data Scientist [(The Alan Turing Institute)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/spotlights/camila-rangel-smith)*
- [crangelsmith@turing.ac.uk](mailto:crangelsmith@turing.ac.uk)

Dr. Rangel Smith contributed data science expertise during the initial Alan Turing Institute phase of the project, helping to bridge the gap between advanced computational methods and practical archaeological applications.
