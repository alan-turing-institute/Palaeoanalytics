# About PyLithics

## The Project

PyLithics is the result of the [Palaeoanalytics project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/palaeoanalytics), a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and the University of Cambridge. This innovative project applies cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision techniques to archaeological research, specifically focusing on the quantitative analysis of prehistoric stone tools.

## Mission

Our mission is to revolutionize archaeological lithic analysis by providing researchers with powerful, accessible, and scientifically rigorous tools for extracting quantitative data from stone artifact illustrations. PyLithics democratizes advanced computational methods, making them available to the global archaeological community.

## The Team

### Project Leadership

ðŸ“§ [jg760@cam.ac.uk](mailto:jg760@cam.ac.uk)
ðŸ”— [@JasonGellis](https://github.com/JasonGellis)

Dr. Gellis leads the technical development of PyLithics and brings expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and archaeological methodology. His research focuses on the intersection of computational methods and archaeological science.

**Prof. Robert Foley**
*Principal Investigator (University of Cambridge)*
ðŸ“§ [raf10@cam.ac.uk](mailto:raf10@cam.ac.uk)
ðŸ”— [@Rob-LCHES](https://github.com/Rob-LCHES)

Professor Foley provides archaeological expertise and project oversight. His extensive experience in human evolution and prehistoric technology ensures that PyLithics meets the needs of the archaeological research community.

### Core Development Team

**Dr. Camila Rangel Smith**
*Research Data Scientist (The Alan Turing Institute)*
ðŸ“§ [crangelsmith@turing.ac.uk](mailto:crangelsmith@turing.ac.uk)
ðŸ”— [@crangelsmith](https://github.com/crangelsmith)

Dr. Rangel Smith contributes data science expertise and helps bridge the gap between advanced computational methods and practical archaeological applications.

## Institutional Affiliations

### The Alan Turing Institute
The UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, providing computational expertise and infrastructure for the project.

### University of Cambridge
The Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies (LCHES) provides archaeological expertise and access to extensive lithic collections for method development and validation.

## Project History

The Palaeoanalytics project began with the recognition that archaeological analysis could benefit enormously from advances in computer vision and machine learning. Traditional lithic analysis, while scientifically rigorous, is time-intensive and subject to inter-observer variability. PyLithics was developed to address these challenges while maintaining the high standards of archaeological science.

### Development Timeline

- **2020**: Project initiation and initial method development
- **2021**: Core team formation and algorithm development
- **2022**: Beta testing with archaeological datasets
- **2023**: Public release and community engagement
- **2024**: Continued development and feature expansion

## Research Impact

PyLithics has been designed to support multiple types of archaeological research:

### Methodological Advances
- Quantitative analysis of lithic assemblages
- Standardization of measurement protocols
- Reduction of inter-observer variability
- Large-scale comparative studies

### Archaeological Applications
- Technological analysis of prehistoric industries
- Cultural transmission studies
- Skill assessment in prehistoric populations
- Temporal and spatial variation in tool-making traditions

## Open Science Commitment

PyLithics embodies principles of open science:

- **Open Source**: All code is freely available under GPL v3.0
- **Transparent Methods**: Processing algorithms are fully documented
- **Reproducible Research**: Analysis parameters are recorded and sharable
- **Community Driven**: Development guided by user needs and feedback
