# üìñ About the project <a name="about"></a>
Archaeologists have long used stone tools (lithics) to reconstruct the behavior of prehistoric hominins. While techniques 
have become more quantitative, there still remain barriers to optimizing data retrieval. Machine learning and computer 
vision approaches can be developed to extract quantitative and trait data from lithics, photographs and drawings. `PyLithics`
has been developed to capture data from 2D line drawings, focusing on the size, shape and technological attributes of flakes. 

`PyLithics`is an open-source, free for use, software package for processing lithic artefact illustrations scanned from 
the literature. This tool accurately identifies, outlines and computes lithic shape and linear measures, and returns user 
ready data. It has been optimized for feature extraction and measurement using a number of computer vision techniques 
including pixel intensity thresholding, edge detection, contour finding, custom template matching and image kernels. 
On both conventional and modern drawings, `PyLithics`can identify and platform, lateral, dorsal, and ventral surfaces,
as well as individual dorsal surface scar shape, size, orientation, diversity, number, and flaking order. Complete size
and shape metrics of individual scars and whole flakes can be calculated and recorded. Orientation and flaking direction 
of dorsal scars can also be calculated. The resulting data can be used for metrical analysis, extracting features indicative
of both typologies and technological processes. Data output can easily be employed to explore patterns of variation within and between assemblages.

# üì¶ The PyLithics package <a name="pylithics"></a>

## Workflow

The workflow of PyLithics is the following:

1. Read lithic image, and based on its name find its associated scale image (these are linked to each other in an input csv file).
2. Calculate a conversion of pixels to millimeters based on the size of the scale.
3. Process input lithic image, removing noise and applying thresholding.
4. Apply edge detection and contour finding to processed image.
5. Calculate metrics to the resulting contours: area, length, breath, shape, number of vertices.   
6. Select contours that can be either the outline of a lithic object (surfaces) or inner scar that is more than
   3% and less than 50% of the total size of its surface.
7. Classify these selected contours of surfaces as "Dorsal","Ventral","Platform". Assign scars contours to 
   a surface. 
7. If available, find arrows, measure their angle and assign it their scar.
8. Plot final resulting surface and scar contours on the original images for validation.    
8. Output data in a hierarchical json file detailing measurements of surface and scar contours. 

In figure X you can find a schema of the workflow described above.

## Installation
The `PyLithics` package requires Python 3.7 or greater. To install, start by creating a fresh conda environment.
```
conda create -n paleo python=3.7
conda activate paleo
```

Get the source.
```
git clone https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Palaeoanalytics.git
```

Enter the repository and check out a relevant branch if necessary (the develop branch contains the most up to date stable version of the code).
```
cd Palaeoanalytics
git checkout develop
```
Install OpenCV using conda and the rest of packages using `pip`.
```
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
pip install .
```

## Running PyLithics


*Pylithics* can be run via command line. The following command displays all available options:

```bash
pylithics_run --help
```

Output:

```bash
usage: pylithics_run [-h] -c config-file [--input_dir INPUT_DIR]
                     [--output_dir OUTPUT_DIR]

Run lithics characterisation pipeline

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config-file, --config config-file
                        the model config file (YAML)
  --input_dir INPUT_DIR
                        path to input directory where images are found
  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        path to output directory to save processed image
                        outputs
  --metadata_filename METADATA_FILENAME
                        CSV file with metadata on images and scales
  --get_arrows          If a lithic contains arrows, find them and add them to
                        the data

```

For example, given that you have a set of lithics images (and it respective scales), you can run the pylithics processing script with the
following:

```python
pylithics_run -c configs/test_config.yml --input_dir <path_to_input_dir> --output_dir <path_to_output_directory> --metadata_filename metatada_file.csv
```

This ```test_config.yml``` config file contains the following options:


```yaml

threshold: 0.01
contour_parameter: 0.1
contour_fully_connected: 'low'
minimum_pixels_contour: 0.01
denoise_weight: 0.06
contrast_stretch: [4, 96]

```

This config is optimised to work with the images in the example dataset. If you want use PyLithics with different stiles of
drawing you might have to modify this configuration file. You can modify or create your on config file and provide it to the CLI. 

<!--
#TODO: Add a comment about the example dataset when avalaible. 
-->

The images found in ```<path_to_input_dir>``` should follow this directory structure:

```bash
input_directory
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metatada_file.csv
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images 
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lithic_id1.png
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lithic_id2.png
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lithic_id3.png
            .
            .
            .
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lithic_idn.png
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  scales
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scale_id1.png
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scale_id2.png
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scale_id3.png
            .
            .
            .
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scale_id4.png



```

where the mapping between the lithics and scale images should be available in the metadata CSV file. 

This CSV file should have as a minimum the following 3 variables:
 
- *PA_ID*:  corresponding the the lithics image id
(the name of the image file), 
- *scale_ID*: The scale id (name of the scale image file)
- *PA_scale*: The scale measurement (how many centimeters this scale represents).

An example of this table, where one scale correspond to several images is the following:

|PA_ID | scale_ID  | PA_scale  | 
|------|-----------|-----------|
| lithic_id1    | scale_id1       | 5         | 
| lithic_id2    | scale_id2       | 5         |
| lithic_id3    | scale_id3       | 5         |   

**Note**

In the scenario that the scale and csv file are not available, it is possible to run the analysis only using the images
with the command:

```
pylithics_run -c configs/test_config.yml --input_dir <path_to_input_dir> --output_dir <path_to_output_directory> 
```
lithics image files must still be inside  the '<path_to_input_dir>/images/' directory). However, all the measurements will only be
provided as number of pixels. 

## PyLithics Output

<!--
#TODO: Update Figures when avalaible
-->

### Output images

Output images are saved in the output directory for validation of the data extraction process. An example of these images
are the following: 

<p float="left">
<img src="figures/rub_al_khali_lithic_surfaces.png" width="310" />
<img src="figures/rub_al_khali_lithium_scars.png" width="310" />
<img src="figures/rub_al_khali_lithium_angles.png" width="310" />
</p>

### Output data

The output dataset is a JSON file with data for the lithic objects found in an image. The data is 
hierarchically organised by type of surface object (ventral, dorsal, platform). For each 
surface the metrics form its scars are recorded. In [this data output example](output_example.md) you can find the json file
resulting of running `PyLithics` on the above images, with comments to better understand the hierarchy and variables.
